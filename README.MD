# FastAPI Project

This repository contains a backend project built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Alembic**.  
The goal is to learn about the tooling for backend development, focusing on database modeling, migrations, and API creation.

# Here

The `table_crud` module was made just so I can easily add data to the database, without needing to open **pgAdmin**.  
It provides simple functions to insert initial/test data into tables, making development and testing smoother.
